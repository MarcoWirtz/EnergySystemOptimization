## Models

Some Python code:
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

### Basic model
Inline `code` looks like that.

### Type day clustering


### Discrete sizing


### Part load efficiency


## Visualization

### Hourly time steps of complete year (8760 time steps)

#### Yearly plot (averaged over months) (1 plot)
#### Monthly plot (averaged over days) (12 plots)
#### Daily plot (365 plots)
#### Carpet plot
#### Box plot (daily profile)
#### Box plot (seasonal profile)

### Type days
#### Visualization method 1
#### Visualization method 2
#### Visualization method 3

### Others
#### Scatter density plot
#### Matrix illustration

## Further tools
### Gurobi solver tuning
